pChart PHP 5 Compatibility
==========================

pChart is a great charting library for PHP.  It's hard to beat.
However, it has not been updated in a long time and it's compatibility
with PHP 5 will soon be lost because of new language features 
(namely constuctors can no longer be the class name as off PHP 5.3.3)

## Goals

The goal of this project is:
 - Update pChart to use PHP 5 object-oriented language features
 - Fix bugs
 - Refactor as needed
